##Greetings. I'm junior web developer. I'm really excited about my job, so it would be a pleasure for me to make a website / web app for you. I spend a lot of time on reading books, documentations and watching different creative design videos, so i have much of «borrowed» experience, which I'd like to use to make your website as responsible and optimizated as it possible.
